# Accessible Astro Starter

This starter project is build upon the (awesome) Astro static site builder. For their official documentation check their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro). This starter offers a couple of Accessibility components and some utility classes to get you building your project faster. To get started simply clone this project to your local folders and then follow Astro's commands such as `npm install`, `npm start` and `npm run build`. ðŸ™‚ Also check out the [Accessible Astro Components](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-components) which can be used with (or without) this starter!

## Accessibility features

In this starter you'll find a couple of things:

- Accessible landmarks in the `DefaultLayout.astro` file such as `header`, `main` and `footer`
- Accessible landmark examples in the `index.astro` file such as `section` and `nav`
- `SkipLinks.astro` component to skip to either the main menu or the main content
- `Navigation.astro` component with keyboard accessible navigation (arrow keys, escape key)
- `ResponsiveToggle.astro` component with an accessible responsive toggle button for the navigation
- `DarkMode.astro` component toggle with accessible button and a user system preferred color scheme
- Outline focus indicator which works on dark and light backgrounds
- `.sr-only` token class for screen reader only text content

## Other features

This starter contains some extra Design System like utility classes to aid in the global layout of your project. All of this can be found in the `public/scss/base` directory, and compiles in the `globals.scss` file. Using these primitives is totally optional, use or remove at your own preference :) What it contains:

- Reset file to reset browser defaults and ensure everything looks good
- Some basic font settings, such as responsive heading sizes
- Color shades for your color pallet, rendered to the `:root` of your website as custom properties
- Simple auto-grid setting using `display: grid` and a `data-attribute`
- A bit more advanced grid settings using `display` grid to easily setup a 12-column layout
- Utilities set in `_utility.scss` for things such as spacing, sizes, colors, and box-shadows

### Using Auto Grid

Simply apply the `data-auto-grid` attribute on your parent `div` with a number from 2-6 (if you need more columns just tweak the for loop in `_auto-grid.scss`). The grid automatically creates new rows (this is how `display: grid` works by default).

```html
<div class="container" data-auto-grid="3">
  <p>First column</p>
  <p>Second column</p>
  <p>Third column</p>
</div>
```

You can also center the contents of the cell using the `data-grid-center` attribute. Use it together with `data-auto-grid`.

```html
<div class="container" data-auto-grid="3" data-grid-center>
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

_Examples are included in the index.astro file_

### Using Grid

Grid enables you to build a little more complex layouts if need be. Using `display: flex;` you can define the amount of columns `.cells` should take up in your `.grid`, and for which breakpoint they should do so. You can also use offset on a grid to create an extra column of offset. For all examples check [my documentation website](https://markteekman.nl/project/flexbox-grid).

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="grid gutters">
    <div class="cell small-12 medium-3">
      <h3>Sidebar</h3>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
    <div class="cell small-12 medium-8 offset-medium-1">
      <h3>Main</h3>
      <!-- ... -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

_Examples are included in the index.astro file_

### Using Margin and Padding

To prevent spacing each element in your website individually and to prevent inconsistencies, you can use the `.margin-#` and `.padding-#` utility classes. A good practice is to set in on your `<section>` elements, for starters. To space out content you can use a special `.space-content` class on your parent div (for example in a `.cell` of your `.grid`). By default, margin/padding top and bottom are set with these utilities. You can also set it explicitly using either `.top` of `.bottom` class tokens. Find or tweak all spacing options in `_space.scss`.

```html
<section class="padding-32">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="margin-16 bottom">Grid example</h2>
  </div>
</section>
```

_Examples are included in the index.astro file_

### Using Sizes

If you need an exception on your font-size for a specific reason you can use size utility classes to accomplish that. Using it is easy. Find or tweak all spacing options in `_size.scss`.

```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="size-20">I'm a bigger font size!</p>
</div>
```

_Examples are included in the index.astro file_

## Using Colors

You can setup your own color schemes in the `_colors.scss` file. You'll find a SCSS map, which gets printed inside `_root.scss` as custom properties.

```scss
$colors: (
  primary-clr: (
    100: hsl(262, 90%, 95%),
    200: hsl(262, 100%, 88%),
    300: hsl(262, 100%, 78%),
    400: hsl(268, 82%, 60%),
    500: hsl(273, 79%, 48%),
  ),
  // ...
);
```
